# Tip Calculator

Tip Calculator is an iOS application for calculating a particular percentage of
tips of the total price received in receipt.
It is designed for educational purposes.
It demonstrates the basics of working with SwiftUI by providing a simple
interface to calculate the tip percentage of a given amount.

## Features

- **Single Screen**: The app has one screen with a text field to input a number
  and a “spinner” to adjust the tip percentage.
- **Real-Time Calculation**: As you adjust the spinner, the app recalculates and
  displays the tip amount in real-time.
